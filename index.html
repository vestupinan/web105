    <h2>Story Line</h2>
    <p>The story begins by introducing Mehmets life style with his daughter Ova and mother,
        they live a very humble life in a small town in Turky. The antagonist is the towns 
        commander and his child who happens to be the same age as Mehmets daughter. The first
        encounter between Mehmet and The Commander, happened when The Commander bought 
        his daughter a backpack Ova saw first. Due to lack of money Mehmet was
        unable to purches the backpack for Ova which lead to The Commander buying it fro this
        daughter.</p>
    <p>One evening while Mehmet was on a walk he came across The Commanders daughter who happened
        to have on the backpack. The little girl took advantage of Mehmet diability and teased him to chase her and go after
        the backpack. The Commanders daughter ran to a rocky coast where she slipped, it hit 
        head against a rock and fell in the ocean, she then lost consciousness and eventually died.
        Due to unfortunate circumstances Mehmet was accused of her death and sent to prison.
    </p>
    <p>Prison was confusing to Mehment, he was very unsure on why he was there. Mehmets inmates soon
        realized he was intellectually disabled and innocent. They did everything in their power to help him 
        even sneak Ova in to see Mehmet. On the day of Mehmets death penalty an inmate 
        sacrificed his life to save Mehmets. Mehemts then escaped and fleed town with Ova to live 
        a happy and peacful life.
